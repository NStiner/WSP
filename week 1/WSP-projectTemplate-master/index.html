    <h1>Nicole Stiner</h1>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Nicole Stiner and I'm from Ohio. Im 21 years old and I love meeting new people and making new
		friends! I came to FullSail University to pursue a bachelors degree in web development and design. I am new to
		the field, but was always interested in it. I always loved creating my profiles on MySpace, and even created
		ones for my friends and family members. I have always been a tech chick and thought this was a great path for me
		to go down. Some of this is very hard to learn and grasp, but I'm hoping I make great progress and become very
		successful with this. I created this page as a portfolio to hold my class projects and I plan to use this as my
		portfolio for future employers. </p>

<h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
	<p>One thing I would like to practice on this month is my drop down/fly out menus. I think these navigational styles
	always look fantastic and make navigating the page much more easier and simpler than if you were to have a long
	navigational list. Using these types of components allow you to combine items that are alike, that make it easier
	for your viewers to find what they need. </p>

<h3>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD</h3>
	<p>We are learning components in WDD and drop down / flyout menus are a great example of this. They allow creators
	to give their viewers a more efficient way to navigate throughout the page and makes it easier to find specific
	content or sections.</p>

<h3>HOW MIGHT I CREATE THIS?</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>If you're using this component as a navigational system, then you first start out with a '< header >' element.</li>
		<li>Next enter in your branding or title by using a heading or img, such as < h1 >, < h2 >, or < h3 >, and < img ></li>
		<li>Then you create your navigation items by creating the < nav > tag and placing your < ul >, or main title and
		then adding < li >'s nested into the < ul >'s to create your drop down content.</li>
	</ol>

<h2>ACCORDIANS/PANELS</h2>
<h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
	<p>I would like to expand my knowledge of Accordians and panels. I have tried to use them in the past and I could
	never get them to work properly. Panels and Accordians can either be horizontal or vertical and can be styled
	many ways.</p>

<h3>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD</h3>
	<p>Accordions and panels are a great way to save space on your page. You can conform information that is alike
	into the accordion/panel. When the user wants to look at a specific topic in the accordion/panel they can just
	click on the tab/title/ or button to minimize or drop down the information of what they selected. </p>

<h2>IMAGE GALLERY/ ROTATING IMAGES</h2>
<h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
	<p>Image rotation is a nice component to use to keep your page style new every day. Everytime a user comes to your
	page, the main picture would be different, even if they refresh, when you have rotating images set up. Its a great
	way to keep your website from looking the same when you have regular viewers.</p>

<h3>HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD</h3>
	<p>We are learning components in WDD and this is a great component to use for imaging on your webpage.</p>

<h2>MULTI COLUMN FOOTER</h2>
<h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
	<p>I can do footers easily, no problem. What I have an issue with though, is creating a multi-column footer.
	Every time I have tried to do a multi-column, they never come out right and always overlap one another.</p>

<h3>HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD</h3>
	<p>I have learned how to do multi-columns in HTML and I have learned how to do a footer. Combining the two, however,
	I havent learned much about. Many websites today use multi-column footers, so it would be a great component
	to learn.</p>
